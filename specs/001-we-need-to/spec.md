# Feature Specification: Troubleshoot Product Options Visibility

**Feature Branch**: `001-we-need-to`  
**Created**: 2025-09-10  
**Status**: Complete  
**Input**: User description: "we need to troubleshoot why all of the product options or product lines default_options are not appearing in the current configurator section, even though they are appearing as option sets in the configurator"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí PARSED: Issue with product options visibility in configurator
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Users configuring products
   ‚Üí Actions: Viewing/selecting product options
   ‚Üí Data: Product lines, default_options, option sets
   ‚Üí Constraints: Options appear in option sets but not current configurator
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí CLARIFIED: Primary issue with Polished product line, but affects all lines for accessories
   ‚Üí CLARIFIED: Layout follows code_order collection for SKU building and configuration_ui collection for display order
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí User flow: Access configurator ‚Üí Select product line ‚Üí View available options
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
6. Identify Key Entities (product data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí SUCCESS: All clarifications resolved
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user visits the product configurator to customize a mirror product. They select the Polished product line (or any product line) and expect to see all available configuration options (frame colors, thicknesses, controls, accessories, etc.) populated in the current configurator section based on the product line's default_options. Currently, while these options appear as option sets elsewhere, they are not properly displaying in the main configurator interface where users make their selections. This particularly affects accessories which are assigned in default_options for all product lines but not rendering in the current configurator section.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user selects the Polished product line in the configurator, **When** the configurator loads the configuration options, **Then** all default_options associated with that product line should be visible and selectable in the current configurator section
2. **Given** accessories are defined in default_options for all product lines, **When** a user navigates to the configurator, **Then** the accessories should appear in the current configurator section for any selected product line
3. **Given** option sets are properly loaded and visible elsewhere, **When** the same data is used for the current configurator section, **Then** the options should display consistently across all interface components
4. **Given** the code_order collection defines SKU building order and configuration_ui collection defines display order, **When** options are rendered, **Then** they should appear in the correct sequence in the current configurator section

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a product line has no default_options defined?
- How does the system handle when default_options reference non-existent option items?
- What occurs when the API call for default_options fails but option sets load successfully?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display all product line default_options in the current configurator section when a product line is selected
- **FR-002**: System MUST ensure consistent option visibility between option sets and current configurator displays
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to see and interact with all available configuration options for their selected product line
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide clear feedback when options are not available or when loading fails
- **FR-005**: System MUST handle cases where default_options array is empty or contains invalid references

- **FR-006**: System MUST load options for the Polished product line specifically and ensure accessories appear for all product lines as defined in their default_options
- **FR-007**: System MUST display options following the order defined by the code_order collection for SKU building and the configuration_ui collection for configurator display sequence

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Product Line**: Contains default_options array that defines which configuration options should be available for products in that line (particularly affected: Polished product line)
- **Default Options**: Array of option references that determine what choices users see in the configurator (especially accessories which are assigned to all product lines)
- **Option Sets**: Currently working display of available options that appears elsewhere in the interface
- **Current Configurator Section**: The main interface component where users make product configuration selections
- **Configuration Options**: Individual selectable items (frame colors, thicknesses, controls, accessories, etc.) that users can choose from
- **Code Order Collection**: Defines the order in which SKUs are rendered in the SKU builder
- **Configuration UI Collection**: Determines the order collections appear in the configurator interface
