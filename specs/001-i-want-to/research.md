# Research: Product Line Default Options Integration

**Feature**: Product Line Default Options Integration  
**Research Date**: 2025-09-25  
**Status**: Complete

## Technical Decisions

### Database Schema Analysis
- **product_lines table**: Contains `default_options` field (M2A relationship)
- **products table**: Contains option overrides that supersede product line defaults
- **Rules engine**: Powered by `rules` table in Supabase for business logic

### Architecture Approach
- **API-First**: All option loading driven by Supabase queries
- **State Management**: Zustand for client-side state management (latest version)
- **Validation**: Zod schemas for runtime type safety
- **Performance**: Query optimization with proper indexing for M2A relationships

### Key Technical Insights

#### M2A Relationship Handling
- Product line default options stored as Many-to-Any relationship
- Query strategy: Join product_lines with related option sets
- Override strategy: Product-level options take precedence over line defaults

#### Rules Engine Integration
- Rules table defines business logic for option compatibility
- Query rules based on current product/product line context
- Apply rules to filter available options dynamically

#### Performance Considerations
- Cache frequently accessed product line defaults
- Minimize database queries during product switching
- Pre-fetch related option sets to meet 100ms requirement

### Testing Strategy
- Use Supabase MCP tools for schema validation
- Chrome DevTools MCP for UI interaction testing
- Network tab monitoring for API performance validation
- No separate test files - rely on MCP tool validation

### Implementation Priority
1. **Database Query Optimization**: Efficient M2A relationship queries
2. **State Management Setup**: Zustand store for option state
3. **Rules Engine Integration**: Query and apply business rules
4. **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for missing data
5. **Performance Optimization**: Meet 100ms response requirement

## Resolved Unknowns
- ✅ M2A relationship query strategy defined
- ✅ State management library selected (Zustand)
- ✅ Testing approach clarified (MCP tools only)
- ✅ Performance targets established (100ms)
- ✅ Error handling strategies defined
