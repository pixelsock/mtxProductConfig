# Feature Specification: Product Line Default Options Integration

**Feature Branch**: `001-i-want-to`  
**Created**: 2025-09-25  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I want to ensure that the option sets that are loading are being pulled in from the product_line_default_options filed inside the product-lines table. This is a M2A field. The only edge case is product option overrides found in the products table. This simply overrides the default options if that product is selected or filtered down to in the configurator. You have access to supabase mcp tools, and chrome devtools mcp server for validating schemas and testing."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-25
- Q: When a product line has no default options configured in `product_line_default_options`, what should the system display to the user? ‚Üí A: Show empty configurator with message "No options available for this product line"
- Q: How quickly should the system respond when switching between products with different option configurations? ‚Üí A: Under 100ms - Near instant visual feedback
- Q: When a product has invalid or missing option overrides, how should the system behave? ‚Üí C: Block configuration and display error requiring admin intervention
- Q: When the M2A relationship for `product_line_default_options` references non-existent option sets, what should happen? ‚Üí B: Show error message and prevent configurator from loading
- Q: During the transition when switching from one product to another with different option sets, should users see a loading indicator? ‚Üí D: Show subtle animation/transition effect instead of loading spinner

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a customer configuring a product, I need to see the correct default option sets based on the selected product line, with any product-specific overrides applied when I narrow down to a specific product, so that I only see relevant and available options for my configuration.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user selects a product line (Deco, Thin, or Tech), **When** the configurator loads the available options, **Then** the system displays the default option sets defined in the product_line_default_options field for that product line
2. **Given** a user has filtered down to a specific product within a product line, **When** that product has option overrides defined in the products table, **Then** the system displays the overridden options instead of the product line defaults
3. **Given** a user switches between different products in the same product line, **When** some products have overrides and others don't, **Then** the system correctly shows product-specific options for override products and default options for non-override products (e.g., Product Line A has default sizes 1-8, but Product X within that line has size override 7-10, so when Product X is selected, sizes 7-10 are shown instead of 1-8)
4. **Given** a product line has default options configured, **When** a specific product within that line has partial overrides, **Then** the system shows the overridden options where specified and falls back to product line defaults for non-overridden categories

### Edge Cases
- When a product line has no default options configured in product_line_default_options, the system displays an empty configurator with the message "No options available for this product line"
- When a product has corrupted or unreachable option override data, the system blocks configuration and displays an error requiring admin intervention (validation via CLI commands, not hardcoded fallbacks)
- When the M2A relationship for product_line_default_options references non-existent option sets, the system shows an error message and prevents the configurator from loading (verified through Supabase CLI schema validation)
- All error states must be validated using command-line verification tools rather than implementing hardcoded fallback logic

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST load default option sets from the product_line_default_options M2A field when a product line is selected
- **FR-002**: System MUST apply product-specific option overrides from the products table when a specific product is selected or filtered
- **FR-003**: System MUST prioritize product-level overrides over product line defaults when both exist
- **FR-004**: System MUST gracefully handle missing or invalid option configurations using CLI validation commands rather than hardcoded fallbacks
- **FR-005**: System MUST maintain option set consistency when users navigate between products within the same product line (validated via CLI consistency checks)
- **FR-006**: System MUST validate that all referenced option sets exist and are accessible using Supabase CLI verification
- **FR-008**: System MUST display "No options available for this product line" message when a product line has no configured default options
- **FR-010**: System MUST block configuration and display admin error when option override data is corrupted or unreachable (verified via CLI validation)
- **FR-011**: System MUST show error message and prevent configurator loading when product_line_default_options references non-existent option sets (verified via CLI schema validation)
- **FR-012**: System MUST display subtle animation/transition effects when switching between products with different option sets (no loading spinners)

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: Option loading and display updates must complete within 100ms for optimal user experience
- **NFR-002**: Option set transitions must use smooth animations rather than loading spinners to maintain user engagement

### Key Entities
- **Product Line**: Contains default_options field (M2A) that defines the standard option sets available for all products in that line
- **Product**: May contain option overrides that supersede the product line defaults for specific configuration categories
- **Option Set**: Individual configuration categories that can be assigned at either product line or product level
- **Option Override**: Product-specific configuration that takes precedence over product line defaults
