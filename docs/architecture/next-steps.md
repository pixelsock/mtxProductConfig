# Next Steps

## Story Manager Handoff

Ready to begin epic implementation with comprehensive architectural foundation. Story Manager should work with this brownfield enhancement architecture using:

- **Reference Document:** This complete brownfield architecture document defining OptionRegistry, generic getOptions(), dynamic UI rendering, and enhanced rules engine
- **Integration Requirements:** Validated evolutionary approach extending existing React + TypeScript + Directus patterns while maintaining UMD library compatibility
- **Existing System Constraints:** Preserve current service layer architecture, shadcn/ui component foundation, and 5-minute caching infrastructure based on actual project analysis
- **First Story Implementation:** Begin with Epic 1, Story 1.2 (OptionRegistry implementation) with clear integration checkpoints validating metadata loading and cache behavior
- **System Integrity Focus:** Maintain existing configurator functionality throughout implementation with parallel code paths during transition

## Developer Handoff

Implementation guide for development team starting brownfield enhancement:

- **Architectural Reference:** This document plus existing coding standards analyzed from actual project (TypeScript strict mode, 2-space indentation, kebab-case services, PascalCase components)
- **Integration Requirements:** Extend existing `src/services/directus.ts` patterns for OptionRegistry, follow established React component architecture for Dynamic UI Renderer
- **Key Technical Decisions:** Build upon existing Directus SDK v17.0.2 integration, maintain UMD build process, preserve ImageWithFallback component patterns based on real project constraints
- **Compatibility Requirements:** **MISSION CRITICAL** - All existing functions like `getActiveFrameColors()` must be systematically eliminated with comprehensive tracking to ensure 100% CMS control
- **Implementation Sequence:** Phase 1: OptionRegistry → Phase 2: Dynamic UI → Phase 3: Rules Engine → Phase 4: **CRITICAL** Legacy function elimination with automated validation

## Critical Success Metrics
- ✅ Zero hard-coded data functions remain in final implementation
- ✅ Complete administrative control via Directus CMS validated
- ✅ All existing configurator functionality preserved during enhancement
- ✅ UMD library deployment compatibility maintained

**Architecture Status: COMPLETE & VALIDATED**
Ready for Story Manager and Developer handoff to begin Epic 1 implementation.
