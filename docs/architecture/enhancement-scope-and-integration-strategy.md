# Enhancement Scope and Integration Strategy

## Enhancement Overview
- **Enhancement Type:** Major Feature Modification - Data-Driven Architecture Transformation
- **Scope:** Transform the configurator from hard-coded option fetching to a fully data-driven system managed through Directus schema, enabling administrators to manage option sets, rules, UI layout, and SKU generation without code changes
- **Integration Impact:** Significant architectural changes to core data layer while maintaining existing API compatibility and user experience

## Integration Approach

**Code Integration Strategy:** 
Evolutionary enhancement of your existing service layer. The new OptionRegistry will extend your current `src/services/directus.ts` patterns, and the generic `getOptions()` function will gradually replace individual collection fetchers like `getActiveFrameColors()`. Existing components will be enhanced to consume metadata-driven configurations while preserving current functionality.

**Database Integration:** 
Extend existing Directus collections rather than replacing them. Add optionally `sku_formulas` collection for dynamic SKU generation, and enhance existing `configuration_ui` collection with metadata fields (label, value_field, display_field, image_field, status_mode, section_sort).

**API Integration:** 
Build upon your existing Directus SDK patterns. The new generic `getOptions()` function will use the same caching, validation, and error handling patterns already established in your service layer. Maintain backward compatibility with existing API consumers.

**UI Integration:** 
Enhance your current shadcn/ui components to dynamically render based on `configuration_ui` metadata. The existing ProductConfig state management and ImageWithFallback patterns will be extended to support metadata-driven configurations.

## Compatibility Requirements
- **Existing API Compatibility:** All current API functions remain functional during transition
- **Database Schema Compatibility:** New collections and fields added without modifying existing schema
- **UI/UX Consistency:** Visual appearance and interaction patterns maintained using existing TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui foundation
- **Performance Impact:** Leverage existing 5-minute caching strategy to ensure negligible performance degradation
