# Infrastructure and Deployment Integration

## Existing Infrastructure
**Current Deployment:** UMD library build via Vite for embedding in external websites, served from CDN or direct integration
**Infrastructure Tools:** Vite 4 build system, TypeScript 5 compiler, npm package management, Directus API at pim.dude.digital
**Environments:** Development (localhost:5173), Production (UMD library deployment), with environment-specific Directus configuration

## Enhancement Deployment Strategy
**Deployment Approach:** Zero infrastructure changes required - enhancement builds as part of existing UMD library bundle with same deployment pipeline
**Infrastructure Changes:** None - new services and components compile into existing single-bundle output, maintaining embedding compatibility
**Pipeline Integration:** Leverage existing `npm run build` process which already handles TypeScript compilation, Vite bundling, and CSS inlining for UMD distribution

## Rollback Strategy
**Rollback Method:** Feature flag approach using existing environment configuration - new OptionRegistry can be disabled to fall back to existing per-collection fetchers during transition period
**Risk Mitigation:** Phased rollout supported by maintaining parallel code paths (existing getActiveFrameColors() alongside new getOptions()) until full migration validated
**Monitoring:** Extend existing console logging patterns and error handling to track OptionRegistry performance and cache hit rates, no additional monitoring infrastructure needed
