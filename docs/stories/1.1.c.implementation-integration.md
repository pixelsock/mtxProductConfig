# Story 1.1.C: Implementation & Integration

## Status: Approved

## Story
**As a** developer,  
**I want** to implement the SKU synchronization fixes based on investigation results,  
**so that** users get immediate SKU updates on the first click without requiring multiple selections.

## Context
**Parent Story:** 1.1 - SKU Generation Sync Fix
**Worktree:** worktree-1-1-c
**Parallel Development:** Yes
**Dependencies:** 1.1.A (Investigation) - needs analysis results

## Sub-story Scope
**Primary Focus:** Code implementation and integration
**File Ownership:** `/src/components/ui/sku-display.tsx`, related component files
**Integration Points:** Uses investigation results from 1.1.A, test framework from 1.1.B
**Excluded Scope:** Does not include investigation or test creation

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **State Synchronization Fixed**: Configuration changes immediately trigger SKU recalculation
2. **useEffect Dependencies Corrected**: All configuration fields properly tracked
3. **Async Processing Synchronized**: Rules processing uses current configuration state
4. **Immediate Responsiveness**: All configuration options update SKU on first click
5. **Integration Validated**: Works with test framework and maintains existing functionality

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] **Implement State Synchronization Fixes** (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Fix useEffect dependencies in SkuDisplay component
  - [ ] Ensure config state changes immediately trigger SKU recalculation
  - [ ] Add proper dependency tracking for all configuration fields
  - [ ] Fix stale closure issues in useEffect hooks

- [ ] **Fix Async Processing Timing** (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Ensure processRules uses current configuration state
  - [ ] Fix async rules processing timing issues
  - [ ] Synchronize SKU computation with state updates
  - [ ] Prevent race conditions in async processing

- [ ] **Verify Immediate Responsiveness** (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Test frame thickness changes update SKU on first click
  - [ ] Verify mounting options work immediately
  - [ ] Confirm color and lighting options respond instantly
  - [ ] Validate all configuration options have identical responsiveness

- [ ] **Integration Testing** (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Use test framework from 1.1.B for validation
  - [ ] Verify rules engine continues to apply correctly
  - [ ] Confirm product matching still works with synchronized state
  - [ ] Test complex configuration scenarios with rapid changes

- [ ] **Code Review and Validation** (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Review implementation against investigation findings
  - [ ] Validate fixes address root cause analysis
  - [ ] Ensure no regression in existing functionality
  - [ ] Confirm performance improvements

## Parallel Development Notes
**Coordination Required:**
- Depends on investigation results from 1.1.A
- Uses test framework from 1.1.B for validation
- Sync with both sub-stories on integration points

**Worktree Setup:**
- Clone repository to: worktrees/worktree-1-1-c
- Branch: story-1-1-c
- Sync schedule: Daily with main branch

**Conflict Prevention:**
- File ownership: `/src/components/ui/sku-display.tsx` and related files
- Shared files: Read-only access to test files and documentation
- Coordination points: Daily sync with investigation and testing teams

## Integration Requirements
**Input Dependencies:**
- Receives investigation results from: 1.1.A (Investigation)
- Uses test framework from: 1.1.B (Testing)
- Source files modified: `/src/components/ui/sku-display.tsx`, `/src/App.tsx`

**Output Dependencies:**
- Provides implementation to: Parent story 1.1
- Code changes: Fixed SKU synchronization implementation
- Data structures modified: useEffect dependencies, state management

**Integration Testing:**
- Cross-sub-story tests: Implementation validation with test framework
- Mock requirements: Use test mocks from 1.1.B
- Test data setup: Use test data from 1.1.B

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All implementation acceptance criteria met
- [ ] SKU updates work immediately on first click
- [ ] Integration with test framework validated
- [ ] No regression in existing functionality
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Ready for parent story integration

## Risk Mitigation
**Identified Risks:**
- Implementation may not address all investigation findings
- Test framework may reveal additional issues
- Integration may require additional changes

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Regular review with investigation team
- Incremental testing with test framework
- Continuous integration validation

**Contingency Plans:**
- If implementation doesn't match investigation: Re-analyze with investigation team
- If test framework reveals issues: Collaborate with testing team
- If integration fails: Escalate to parent story for scope adjustment
