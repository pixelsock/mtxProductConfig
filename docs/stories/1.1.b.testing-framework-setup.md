# Story 1.1.B: Testing Framework Setup

## Status: Approved for parallel development

## Story
**As a** developer,  
**I want** comprehensive test cases and automation framework for SKU synchronization testing,  
**so that** the implementation can be thoroughly validated and regression-tested.

## Context
**Parent Story:** 1.1 - SKU Generation Sync Fix
**Worktree:** worktree-1-1-b
**Parallel Development:** Yes
**Dependencies:** None (can run parallel with 1.1.A)

## Sub-story Scope
**Primary Focus:** Test preparation and automation framework
**File Ownership:** Test files, test data, test utilities, test configuration
**Integration Points:** Provides test framework to 1.1.C (Implementation) for validation
**Excluded Scope:** Does not include actual code fixes or implementation

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **Test Cases Created**: Comprehensive test cases for all configuration options
2. **Automation Framework**: Automated testing setup for SKU synchronization
3. **Test Data Prepared**: Test data for various configuration scenarios
4. **Regression Tests**: Tests to prevent future SKU sync issues
5. **Integration Test Plan**: Cross-component testing strategy

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] **Create Configuration Test Cases** (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Test cases for frame thickness changes
  - [ ] Test cases for color selection updates
  - [ ] Test cases for mounting option changes
  - [ ] Test cases for lighting option updates
  - [ ] Test cases for rapid configuration changes

- [ ] **Set Up Test Automation** (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Configure test runner for SKU synchronization tests
  - [ ] Create test utilities for configuration state management
  - [ ] Set up mock data for rules engine testing
  - [ ] Configure test environment for async processing

- [ ] **Prepare Test Data** (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Create test configuration sets for various scenarios
  - [ ] Prepare expected SKU outputs for validation
  - [ ] Set up test data for complex configuration combinations
  - [ ] Create edge case test scenarios

- [ ] **Create Regression Test Suite** (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Tests to prevent "click twice" behavior regression
  - [ ] Tests for state synchronization integrity
  - [ ] Tests for async processing timing
  - [ ] Tests for rules engine integration

- [ ] **Plan Integration Testing** (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Cross-component test strategy
  - [ ] End-to-end test scenarios
  - [ ] Performance testing for rapid changes
  - [ ] User interaction simulation tests

## Parallel Development Notes
**Coordination Required:**
- Sync with 1.1.A (Investigation) on test case requirements
- Provide test framework to 1.1.C (Implementation) for validation
- Integration testing needed with: 1.1.C

**Worktree Setup:**
- Clone repository to: worktrees/worktree-1-1-b
- Branch: story-1-1-b
- Sync schedule: Daily with main branch

**Conflict Prevention:**
- File ownership: Test files and test data only
- Shared files: Read-only access to source code for test creation
- Coordination points: Daily sync with other sub-stories

## Integration Requirements
**Input Dependencies:**
- Receives context from: Parent story 1.1
- Source files analyzed: `/src/components/ui/sku-display.tsx`, `/src/App.tsx`, `/src/services/rules-engine.ts`

**Output Dependencies:**
- Provides test framework to: 1.1.C (Implementation)
- Test files created: Comprehensive test suite for SKU synchronization
- Data structures used: Test data, mock objects, test utilities

**Integration Testing:**
- Cross-sub-story tests: Test framework validation with implementation
- Mock requirements: Mock rules engine, mock configuration state
- Test data setup: Various configuration scenarios and expected outcomes

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All testing acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Test framework ready for implementation validation
- [ ] Test cases cover all configuration scenarios
- [ ] Automation framework configured and tested
- [ ] Integration test plan documented
- [ ] Ready for implementation phase

## Risk Mitigation
**Identified Risks:**
- Test cases may not cover all edge cases
- Test automation may be complex to set up
- Test data may not reflect real-world scenarios

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Regular review of test case coverage
- Incremental test automation setup
- Validation with real configuration data

**Contingency Plans:**
- If test automation is too complex: Focus on manual test cases
- If test coverage is insufficient: Expand test case development
- If test data is inadequate: Collaborate with investigation team
