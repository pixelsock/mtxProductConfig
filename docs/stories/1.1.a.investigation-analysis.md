# Story 1.1.A: Investigation & Analysis

## Status: Approved for parallel development

## Story
**As a** developer,  
**I want** to thoroughly investigate and document the root cause of SKU synchronization issues,  
**so that** the implementation team has clear guidance for fixing the state management problems.

## Context
**Parent Story:** 1.1 - SKU Generation Sync Fix
**Worktree:** worktree-1-1-a
**Parallel Development:** Yes
**Dependencies:** None

## Sub-story Scope
**Primary Focus:** Root cause analysis and documentation
**File Ownership:** Analysis documents, investigation notes, documentation files
**Integration Points:** Provides investigation results to sub-story 1.1.C (Implementation)
**Excluded Scope:** Does not include any code changes or fixes

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **Root Cause Identified**: Clear documentation of why SKU updates require multiple clicks
2. **Technical Analysis Complete**: Detailed analysis of useEffect dependencies and state flow
3. **Async Processing Mapped**: Documentation of rules processing timing issues
4. **Integration Requirements Defined**: Clear guidance for implementation team
5. **No Code Changes**: Investigation only, no implementation work

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] **Analyze useEffect Dependencies** (AC: 1, 2)
  - [ ] Review SkuDisplay component useEffect hook (lines 41-99)
  - [ ] Map dependency array completeness
  - [ ] Identify missing dependencies causing stale closures
  - [ ] Document React batching impact on state updates

- [ ] **Investigate State Synchronization** (AC: 1, 2)
  - [ ] Trace configuration state flow from App.tsx to SkuDisplay
  - [ ] Analyze setCurrentConfig → useEffect → async rules processing chain
  - [ ] Identify timing issues between state updates and SKU computation
  - [ ] Document state synchronization gaps

- [ ] **Review Async Rules Processing** (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Analyze processRules function timing in rules-engine.ts
  - [ ] Identify stale configuration values in async processing
  - [ ] Map async processing impact on SKU updates
  - [ ] Document timing dependencies

- [ ] **Create Implementation Guide** (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Document specific fixes needed for useEffect dependencies
  - [ ] Define proper dependency tracking requirements
  - [ ] Specify state synchronization improvements needed
  - [ ] Create integration checklist for implementation team

## Parallel Development Notes
**Coordination Required:**
- Sync with 1.1.C (Implementation) on investigation results
- Share analysis findings with 1.1.B (Testing) for test case development
- Integration testing needed with: 1.1.C

**Worktree Setup:**
- Clone repository to: worktrees/worktree-1-1-a
- Branch: story-1-1-a
- Sync schedule: Daily with main branch

**Conflict Prevention:**
- File ownership: Analysis documents only
- Shared files: Read-only access to source code for analysis
- Coordination points: Daily sync with other sub-stories

## Integration Requirements
**Input Dependencies:**
- Receives context from: Parent story 1.1
- Source files analyzed: `/src/components/ui/sku-display.tsx`, `/src/App.tsx`, `/src/services/rules-engine.ts`

**Output Dependencies:**
- Provides analysis to: 1.1.C (Implementation)
- Documentation created: Root cause analysis, implementation guide
- Data structures used: Analysis reports, technical documentation

**Integration Testing:**
- Cross-sub-story tests: Analysis validation with implementation team
- Mock requirements: None (analysis only)
- Test data setup: Analysis of existing codebase

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All investigation acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Root cause analysis documented and validated
- [ ] Implementation guide created and reviewed
- [ ] Analysis results shared with implementation team
- [ ] Documentation updated with findings
- [ ] Ready for implementation phase

## Risk Mitigation
**Identified Risks:**
- Analysis may reveal more complex issues than expected
- Implementation team may need additional clarification
- Investigation scope may expand beyond original estimates

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Regular checkpoints with implementation team
- Document assumptions and limitations clearly
- Escalate scope changes immediately

**Contingency Plans:**
- If analysis reveals major architectural issues: Escalate to Architect
- If implementation guidance is unclear: Schedule additional analysis sessions
- If scope expands significantly: Re-evaluate sub-story boundaries
