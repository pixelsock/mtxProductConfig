Date: 2025-09-05
Reviewer: Bob (Scrum Master)
Target: docs/stories/0.1.system-analysis-and-sku-correlation.md

## Quick Summary
- Story readiness: READY
- Clarity score: 9/10
- Major gaps: None blocking. Minor: could add exact section anchors in refs (optional).

## Validation Table
| Category                             | Status | Issues |
| ------------------------------------ | ------ | ------ |
| 1. Goal & Context Clarity            | PASS   | Clear what/why; epic fit and dependencies implicit; acceptable for analysis scope |
| 2. Technical Implementation Guidance | PASS   | Key files and areas specified; suited to analysis task |
| 3. Reference Effectiveness           | PASS   | References are concrete; anchors optional improvement |
| 4. Self-Containment Assessment       | PASS   | Core info included; assumptions explicit; edge cases noted |
| 5. Testing Guidance                  | PASS   | Test approach and evidence artifacts enumerated; ACs testable |

## Specific Notes
- Evidence artifacts lists under each task will streamline validation and review.
- Mapping template ensures frame thickness → first-character derivation is verified and cited.
- Out-of-scope section prevents scope creep during analysis.

**Final Assessment:** READY — The story provides sufficient context for implementation as an analysis task.
