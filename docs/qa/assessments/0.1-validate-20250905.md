## Template Compliance Issues
- None. Story follows template sections and structure.
- All required sections present; placeholders removed.

## Critical Issues (Must Fix)
- None blocking implementation.

## Should-Fix Issues
- Optional: add exact anchors to architecture refs for faster navigation.

## Nice-to-Have Improvements
- After running analysis, paste the verified frame thickness → first-character mapping back into the story’s mapping template.

## Anti-Hallucination Findings
- All technical claims trace to repo files and architecture docs.
- No invented APIs or libraries detected.

## Final Assessment
- GO
- Implementation Readiness Score: 9/10
- Confidence Level: High

Summary: Story is clear, self-contained for an analysis task, and testable. Evidence artifacts and out-of-scope guardrails are in place. Proceed to implementation and fill mapping values after running the console script.
