# Introduction

This document defines the user experience goals, information architecture, user flows, and visual design specifications for MTX Product Configurator's user interface. It serves as the foundation for visual design and frontend development, ensuring a cohesive and user-centered experience.

## Overall UX Goals & Principles

### Target User Personas

**Primary Administrative User:** Product managers and administrators who need to manage option sets, rules, and configurations in Directus without code changes. They require efficient, error-resistant workflows for complex data management tasks.

**End Customer/Configurator User:** Customers configuring mirror/lighting products who need an intuitive, visual experience with clear feedback and guidance through the configuration process.

**Developer/Integrator:** Technical users implementing the UMD library who need clean APIs, predictable behavior, and comprehensive documentation.

### Usability Goals

- **Ease of Learning:** New customers can complete a basic product configuration within 3 minutes without instruction
- **Administrative Efficiency:** Admin users can add new option sets and rules within 10 minutes using the Directus interface
- **Error Prevention:** Clear validation and confirmation for configuration conflicts and destructive admin actions
- **Visual Clarity:** Product changes are immediately reflected through dynamic image layering and SKU updates

### Design Principles

1. **Data-Driven Flexibility** - All UI elements adapt dynamically to Directus configuration without requiring code changes
2. **Progressive Disclosure** - Complex administrative features are hidden from end users while remaining accessible to admins
3. **Immediate Visual Feedback** - Every configuration change instantly updates product visualization and pricing
4. **Consistent Mental Models** - Similar interaction patterns across different option types (color swatches, dropdowns, multi-select)
5. **Graceful Real-time Updates** - Changes propagate seamlessly with fallback mechanisms for connectivity issues
