# MIRR-C Product Analysis - Polished Mirrors Option Sets

## Product Data Analysis

Based on the MIRR-C product data you provided:

```json
{
  "id": 1859,
  "name": "MIRR-C",
  "sku_code": "MIRR-C",
  "product_line": 23,
  "hanging_technique": "2772f29e-1ea7-4069-8762-de40e940c201",
  "light_direction": null,
  "mirror_style": null,
  "frame_thickness": null
}
```

## Key Insights

### 1. Product Already Has Complete SKU
- **SKU Code**: `MIRR-C` (this is the complete, final SKU)
- **No complex generation needed** - just use this directly

### 2. Available Option Sets for Polished Mirrors
Based on the product data, Polished Mirrors should have these option sets:

1. **Product Line**: `MIRR` (from `sku_code`)
2. **Size**: Dimensions (24x36, etc.)
3. **Hanging Technique**: `2772f29e-1ea7-4069-8762-de40e940c201`

### 3. Null Fields Indicate Unavailable Options
- `light_direction`: null → No lighting options
- `mirror_style`: null → No mirror style options  
- `frame_thickness`: null → No frame thickness options

## The Real Issue

The problem isn't that "3 option sets are available but only 2 are rendering" - it's that:

1. **The current system is hardcoded** to show option sets that don't exist for Polished Mirrors
2. **The system ignores the `sku_code_order` collection** that defines which option sets should be shown
3. **The system doesn't use the product's existing SKU** (`MIRR-C`)

## Expected Behavior for MIRR-C

The system should show:

### Current Selection SKU
- **Display**: `MIRR-C` (use the product's `sku_code` directly)
- **No complex generation** - just show the product SKU

### Current Configuration
- **Product Line**: MIRR (from `sku_code`)
- **Size**: 24" × 36" (from dimensions)
- **Hanging Technique**: [Name from ID] (from `hanging_technique`)

### Option Sets NOT to Show
- Mirror Style (null in product data)
- Lighting (null in product data)
- Frame Thickness (null in product data)
- Frame Color (if not available for this product line)
- Any other option sets that don't have data

## Solution: Ordered SKU System

The **Ordered SKU System** I created solves this by:

1. **Using the product's `sku_code` directly** (`MIRR-C`)
2. **Following the `sku_code_order` collection** to determine which option sets to show
3. **Only displaying option sets that have data** for the specific product line
4. **Dynamically rendering** based on actual availability, not hardcoded sections

## Test Scripts Created

1. **`src/test/polished-mirrors-specific-test.ts`** - Tests with MIRR-C product
2. **`src/test/mirr-c-specific-analysis.ts`** - Analyzes MIRR-C data structure
3. **`src/test/polished-mirrors-diagnostic.ts`** - General diagnostic

## Implementation

To fix the Polished Mirrors issue:

1. **Replace hardcoded components** with ordered versions
2. **Use the product's `sku_code` directly** (`MIRR-C`)
3. **Let the `sku_code_order` collection** determine which option sets to show
4. **Only show option sets that have data** for the product line

## Expected Results

After implementing the ordered SKU system:

- ✅ **SKU Display**: Shows `MIRR-C` (product's actual SKU)
- ✅ **Current Configuration**: Shows only available option sets
- ✅ **Dynamic Rendering**: Based on actual data, not hardcoded sections
- ✅ **Correct Option Sets**: Only shows what's actually available for Polished Mirrors

The ordered SKU system will ensure that Polished Mirrors shows exactly the right option sets based on the actual product data and the `sku_code_order` collection configuration.
