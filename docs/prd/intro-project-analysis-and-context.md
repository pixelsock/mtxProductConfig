# Intro Project Analysis and Context

This document outlines the plan to make the existing configurator fully data-driven from a Directus schema. It serves as a foundational guide for developers and will ensure seamless integration with the existing project.

## Existing Project Overview

* **Analysis Source**: This document is based on a comprehensive plan provided by the project team.
* **Current Project State**: A configurator application with core option collections, a UI driver, a rules engine, and some existing defaults/overrides.

## Available Documentation Analysis

* Using existing project analysis from the provided plan.

## Enhancement Scope Definition

* **Enhancement Type**: Major Feature Modification
* **Enhancement Description**: The configurator will be made fully data-driven from a Directus schema, allowing administrators to manage option sets, rules, UI layout, and SKU generation with no code changes.
* **Impact Assessment**: This is a major change requiring architectural modifications.

## Goals and Background Context

* **Goals**:
    * Empower administrators to manage all configurator metadata in Directus without code changes.
    * Centralize the definition of what constitutes an "option set."
    * Simplify the codebase by replacing hard-coded logic with a generic, data-driven approach.
* **Background Context**: The existing configurator has hard-coded elements that make it difficult to manage and extend. This enhancement aims to decouple the application logic from the data, making it more flexible and easier to maintain.
