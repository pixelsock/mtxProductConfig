# [2025-01-18] Recap: Configuration Initialization Bug Fix

This recaps what was built for the spec documented at .agent-os/specs/2025-01-18-zustand-migration/spec.md.

## Recap

Fixed a critical configuration initialization bug in the Zustand migration where users encountered a "No Configuration Options Available" error message after selecting a product line. The solution involved modifying the `apiSlice.loadProductLineOptions` method to call `resetConfiguration` after loading options, ensuring proper initialization of the configuration state with default values from the loaded product options.

Key accomplishments:
- Identified and resolved configuration initialization timing issue
- Added proper configuration reset call after product line options are loaded
- Verified environment configuration tests continue to pass (19/19 tests)
- Updated task tracking to reflect completion of the configuration initialization bug fix

## Context

Migrate MTX Product Configurator from React useState to Zustand state management while preserving the fully dynamic, Supabase-driven architecture. The migration will implement slice-based stores for configuration, UI, API, and cache management with TypeScript integration, performance optimizations through selective subscriptions, and enhanced developer experience with DevTools. All existing Supabase integration patterns, rules engine processing, and deterministic evaluation lifecycle must remain unchanged.
