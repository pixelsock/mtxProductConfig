# Spec Summary (Lite)

Replace the remote pim.dude.digital API endpoint with a local Supabase instance running on localhost:8075 to enable offline development and faster iteration cycles. This involves updating the service layer to use configurable endpoints, setting up environment-based configuration, and ensuring all existing features work seamlessly with the local Supabase instance.
