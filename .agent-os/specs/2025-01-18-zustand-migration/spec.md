> Spec: useState to Zustand Migration
> Created: 2025-01-18

## Overview

Migrate the MTX Product Configurator from React useState patterns to Zustand state management while maintaining the fully dynamic, Supabase-driven architecture. This migration will improve performance, reduce prop drilling, and provide better developer experience without compromising the core principle that all configuration logic must be data-driven from Supabase tables.

## User Stories

### Enhanced Developer Experience

As a developer working on the configurator, I want centralized state management so that I can easily access configuration state from any component without prop drilling and have predictable state updates with better debugging capabilities.

**Detailed Workflow:** Developers will use Zustand hooks to access specific slices of state (configuration, UI, API data) from any component, with DevTools integration providing clear visibility into state changes and action dispatching.

### Improved Performance

As a user configuring products, I want faster UI responses so that selection changes feel immediate and the interface doesn't re-render unnecessarily when making configuration choices.

**Detailed Workflow:** Zustand's selective subscriptions will prevent unnecessary re-renders when unrelated state changes occur, while maintaining the current real-time product matching and rules engine processing.

### Maintainable Supabase Integration

As a developer maintaining the codebase, I want the Supabase integration to remain fully dynamic so that all configuration behavior continues to be driven by database tables without any hard-coded logic.

**Detailed Workflow:** The migration will preserve all existing Supabase service patterns, rules engine processing, and dynamic filtering while organizing the state management through Zustand stores that interface with the same API layer.

## Spec Scope

1. **State Architecture Redesign** - Replace useState patterns with Zustand store slices for configuration, UI, API, and cache management
2. **TypeScript Integration** - Implement fully typed Zustand stores with inference and validation
3. **Performance Optimization** - Add selective subscriptions and transient updates for high-frequency operations
4. **Developer Experience** - Integrate DevTools, persistence middleware, and improved debugging
5. **Migration Strategy** - Incremental migration approach that maintains feature compatibility throughout the process

## Out of Scope

- Changes to existing Supabase API integration patterns
- Modifications to rules engine or SKU generation logic
- Alterations to the core evaluation lifecycle (deterministic flow)
- UI component redesign or visual changes
- Changes to the dynamic filtering system architecture

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Working Zustand-based configurator** with identical functionality to current useState implementation
2. **Performance improvements** measurable through reduced re-renders and faster state updates
3. **Enhanced developer experience** with centralized state access and DevTools integration
4. **Maintained Supabase integration** with all existing dynamic behavior preserved
5. **Documentation** covering the new store architecture and migration patterns for future development
