# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-01-18-zustand-migration/spec.md

## Technical Requirements

### Store Architecture Design

**Slice-Based Architecture:**
- ConfigurationSlice: Manages current product configuration, selections, and validation state
- UISlice: Controls modal states, loading indicators, floating bars, and user interface interactions
- APISlice: Handles Supabase data caching, loading states, and error management
- RulesSlice: Manages rules engine state, processing results, and constraint evaluation

**State Shape Design:**
```typescript
interface ConfiguratorStore extends
  ConfigurationSlice,
  UISlice,
  APISlice,
  RulesSlice {}
```

**Middleware Stack:**
- DevTools integration for debugging
- Persist middleware for user preference storage
- Immer for immutable state updates
- SubscribeWithSelector for performance optimization

### TypeScript Integration

**Type Safety Requirements:**
- Full type inference for all store state and actions
- Generic store factories for reusable patterns
- Type guards for Supabase data validation
- Discriminated unions for complex state modeling

**Interface Definitions:**
- Preserve existing ProductConfig, ProductOptions, and Supabase type definitions
- Add Zustand-specific action and selector types
- Maintain compatibility with existing service layer interfaces

### Performance Optimization

**Selective Subscriptions:**
- Use `useShallow` for multi-property selections
- Implement transient updates for real-time preview operations
- Custom equality functions for complex object comparisons
- Conditional subscriptions based on component needs

**Render Optimization:**
- Prevent unnecessary re-renders during configuration changes
- Optimize product matching and image loading operations
- Maintain efficient dynamic filtering performance

### Supabase Integration Preservation

**API Layer Compatibility:**
- Maintain all existing service layer patterns
- Preserve dynamic filtering system architecture
- Keep rules engine processing unchanged
- Retain deterministic evaluation lifecycle

**Data Flow Requirements:**
- API slice manages Supabase data caching and loading states
- Configuration slice consumes API data through selectors
- Rules slice processes constraints without modifying API integration
- UI slice reflects data-driven state changes

### Migration Strategy

**Incremental Approach:**
1. Install Zustand and setup base store structure
2. Migrate API/cache state first (lowest risk)
3. Migrate UI state (modal states, loading indicators)
4. Migrate configuration state (core functionality)
5. Optimize with advanced Zustand features

**Compatibility Requirements:**
- Maintain existing component interfaces during migration
- Preserve all current functionality throughout process
- Keep TypeScript compilation successful at each phase
- Ensure no regression in dynamic Supabase behavior

## External Dependencies

**New Dependencies:**
- **zustand** (^4.4.7) - Core state management library
- **@types/zustand** - TypeScript definitions (if needed)

**Justification:** Zustand is significantly lighter than Redux alternatives (~2.9kB vs ~10kB+), provides excellent TypeScript support, requires minimal boilerplate, and offers performance benefits through selective subscriptions. The library is actively maintained, well-documented, and aligns with the project's preference for simplicity over complexity.
