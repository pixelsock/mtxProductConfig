# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-09-23-recompute-filtering-after-rules/spec.md

## Technical Requirements

- **Two-Phase Filtering** - Maintain existing pre-rule filtering logic but add a second filtering pass after rules have updated the configuration state
- **Store State Coordination** - Ensure the `disabledOptions` in the store reflects the post-rule configuration before UI updates occur
- **Configuration State Management** - Use the `effectiveConfig` (post-rule selections) for the second filtering pass instead of the original `currentSelection`
- **Function Call Sequencing** - Modify the order in `apiSlice.ts` to: 1) apply rules and update store, 2) recompute filtering with effective state, 3) update disabled options
- **Performance Consideration** - Minimize duplicate filtering work while ensuring accuracy of the second pass
