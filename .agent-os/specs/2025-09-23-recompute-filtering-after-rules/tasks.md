# Tasks

## 1. [x] Analyze Current Filtering Logic

1.1. [x] Review the existing filtering flow in `src/store/slices/apiSlice.ts` around lines 288-292
1.2. [x] Identify where `getFilteredOptions` is called with `currentSelection` before rules are applied
1.3. [x] Trace how `disabledOptions` are calculated and stored in the current implementation
1.4. [x] Document the sequence of operations during configuration initialization and rule application

## 2. [x] Implement Two-Phase Filtering Architecture

2.1. [x] Write test cases for post-rule filtering scenarios in configuration initialization
2.2. [x] Modify the filtering logic to accept configuration state as a parameter
2.3. [x] Add a second filtering pass that uses the effective configuration after rules
2.4. [x] Update the store coordination to ensure disabled options reflect post-rule state
2.5. [x] Ensure proper sequencing: apply rules → update store → recompute filtering → update disabled options
2.6. [x] Verify test cases pass with the new two-phase filtering implementation

## 3. [x] Handle Rule-Triggered Updates

3.1. [x] Write test cases for dynamic filtering updates when rules are triggered by user selections
3.2. [x] Ensure rule enforcement immediately triggers filtering recomputation
3.3. [x] Maintain consistency between rule-enforced selections and availability indicators
3.4. [x] Optimize performance to avoid unnecessary duplicate filtering work
3.5. [x] Verify test cases pass for rule-triggered filtering updates

## 4. [x] Integration and Regression Testing

4.1. [x] Write comprehensive test cases covering initialization, rule application, and user selections
4.2. [x] Test configuration initialization with various product/rule combinations
4.3. [x] Verify no regression in existing filtering behavior for user-driven selections
4.4. [x] Test edge cases where rules modify multiple configuration values
4.5. [x] Ensure UI synchronization maintains correct disabled states across all scenarios
4.6. [x] Run full test suite to confirm all tests pass
