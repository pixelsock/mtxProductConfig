# Spec Summary (Lite)

Implement automatic selection adjustment when dynamic filtering disables previously selected options, ensuring users never have disabled options selected by automatically switching to the first available option in the affected option set. This maintains valid configuration state and prevents user confusion when option availability changes based on their selections.
