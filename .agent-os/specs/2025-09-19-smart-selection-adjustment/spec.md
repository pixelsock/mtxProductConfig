> Spec: Smart Selection Adjustment for Dynamic Filtering
> Created: 2025-09-19

## Overview

Implement automatic selection adjustment when dynamic filtering disables previously selected options, ensuring users never have disabled options selected by automatically switching to the first available option in the affected option set.

## User Stories

### Smart Selection Recovery

As a user configuring a product, I want the system to automatically adjust my selections when they become unavailable due to dynamic filtering, so that I never have disabled options selected and can continue configuring without confusion.

When a user selects a mirror style that makes their previously selected light direction unavailable, the system should automatically select the first available light direction option instead of leaving the disabled option selected.

### Seamless Configuration Flow

As a user, I want my configuration choices to remain valid and selectable at all times, so that I can see immediate feedback about available combinations without having to manually fix invalid selections.

The system should proactively maintain a valid configuration state by adjusting selections when dynamic filtering changes availability, allowing users to focus on their preferences rather than fixing invalid states.

## Spec Scope

1. **Dynamic Selection Validation** - Detect when a selected option becomes disabled due to dynamic filtering changes
2. **Automatic Adjustment Logic** - Replace disabled selections with the first available option in the same option set
3. **State Synchronization** - Ensure Zustand state reflects adjusted selections immediately
4. **UI Feedback** - Provide visual indication when selections are automatically adjusted
5. **Cascade Prevention** - Handle multiple option sets being affected by a single change without infinite loops

## Out of Scope

- Manual selection recovery (user choosing replacement)
- Preference-based selection (remembering user patterns)
- Undo functionality for automatic adjustments
- Configuration saving/persistence during adjustments

## Expected Deliverable

1. When a user selects a mirror style that makes their light direction selection unavailable, the light direction automatically changes to the first available option
2. The configuration state remains valid with no disabled options selected
3. Visual feedback indicates when an automatic adjustment has occurred
