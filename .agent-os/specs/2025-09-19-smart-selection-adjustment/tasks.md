# Implementation Tasks

## Parent Task 1: Dynamic Filtering Analysis and Integration

**Objective**: Understand current dynamic filtering implementation and identify integration points for automatic selection adjustment

### Subtask 1.1: Analyze Current Dynamic Filtering Logic
- [ ] Read and understand current dynamic filtering implementation in store
- [ ] Identify where options get disabled/enabled in the filtering process
- [ ] Document the flow of how selections affect option availability
- [ ] Map out the relationship between option sets and filtering dependencies

### Subtask 1.2: Identify Integration Points
- [ ] Find where dynamic filtering updates are triggered
- [ ] Locate the functions that determine option disabled state
- [ ] Identify the best hook point for running selection validation
- [ ] Document current state management flow for configuration updates

## Parent Task 2: Selection Validation Engine

**Objective**: Create the core logic to detect when selections become invalid due to dynamic filtering

### Subtask 2.1: Create Selection Validation Function
- [ ] Implement `validateCurrentSelections()` function
- [ ] Add logic to check if selected options are currently disabled
- [ ] Return list of invalid selections with their option set context
- [ ] Handle edge cases where no selection exists

### Subtask 2.2: Add Validation Hooks
- [ ] Integrate validation calls into dynamic filtering updates
- [ ] Add validation to configuration value changes
- [ ] Ensure validation runs after filtering recalculation
- [ ] Add debouncing to prevent excessive validation calls

## Parent Task 3: Automatic Adjustment Algorithm

**Objective**: Implement the logic to automatically select the first available option when invalid selections are detected

### Subtask 3.1: Create Adjustment Logic
- [ ] Implement `adjustInvalidSelections()` function
- [ ] Add logic to find first available option in each affected option set
- [ ] Update configuration state with adjusted selections
- [ ] Handle cases where no options are available in a set

### Subtask 3.2: Prevent Adjustment Cascades
- [ ] Add cascade prevention flags to avoid infinite loops
- [ ] Implement adjustment batching for multiple simultaneous changes
- [ ] Add timeout mechanisms for safety
- [ ] Track adjustment history to prevent cycles

## Parent Task 4: State Management Integration

**Objective**: Update Zustand store to support automatic selection adjustments

### Subtask 4.1: Update Configuration Slice
- [ ] Add `validateAndAdjustSelections` action to configuration slice
- [ ] Add state tracking for adjustment operations
- [ ] Integrate adjustment logic with existing configuration actions
- [ ] Add selection adjustment event tracking

### Subtask 4.2: Update API Integration
- [ ] Ensure adjustments work with dynamic option loading
- [ ] Handle adjustments during async operations
- [ ] Add proper error handling for adjustment failures
- [ ] Maintain state consistency during adjustments

## Parent Task 5: User Interface Updates

**Objective**: Provide visual feedback and ensure UI reflects automatic adjustments

### Subtask 5.1: Add Adjustment Feedback
- [ ] Create visual indicator for automatically adjusted selections
- [ ] Add brief notification when adjustments occur
- [ ] Highlight adjusted options temporarily
- [ ] Ensure accessibility compliance for feedback

### Subtask 5.2: Update Component Rendering
- [ ] Ensure components re-render with adjusted selections
- [ ] Update option highlighting and selection states
- [ ] Verify disabled state visualization remains correct
- [ ] Test component behavior during rapid adjustments

## Parent Task 6: Testing and Validation

**Objective**: Thoroughly test the adjustment system with various scenarios

### Subtask 6.1: Core Functionality Testing
- [ ] Test basic selection adjustment scenarios
- [ ] Verify cascade prevention works correctly
- [ ] Test multiple simultaneous adjustments
- [ ] Validate state consistency throughout adjustments

### Subtask 6.2: Edge Case Testing
- [ ] Test with empty option sets
- [ ] Test with all options disabled scenarios
- [ ] Test rapid selection changes
- [ ] Test adjustment during async operations

### Subtask 6.3: Integration Testing
- [ ] Test with existing rules system
- [ ] Test with product option overrides
- [ ] Test with dynamic product loading
- [ ] Verify SKU building works with adjusted selections
