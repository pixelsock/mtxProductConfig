- [x] 1.3 Modify get_dynamic_options() SQL function to include configuration_ui data in response
- [x] 1.4 Update API slice to fetch and cache configuration_ui data with product options
- [x] 1.5 Add error handling for malformed or missing configuration_ui data
- [x] 1.6 Update Zustand store to manage configuration_ui state efficiently
- [x] 1.7 Implement data validation for configuration_ui records (sort field, collection existence)
- [x] 1.8 Verify tests pass for configuration_ui data integration

### 2. Dynamic Component Rendering System

- [x] 2.1 Write tests for dynamic component ordering functionality
- [x] 2.2 Create component mapping system that maps collection names to React components
- [x] 2.3 Implement utility function to sort configuration_ui records by sort field ascending

- [x] 2.7 Implement logging for configuration_ui warnings (missing collections, invalid data)
- [x] 2.8 Verify tests pass for dynamic component rendering system

### 3. SQL Function Enhancement

- [x] 3.1 Write tests for updated SQL functions with configuration_ui integration
- [x] 3.2 Update get_dynamic_options() to query configuration_ui table and include sort data
- [x] 3.3 Modify enhanced configurator functions to use configuration_ui instead of hardcoded arrays
- [x] 3.4 Add proper JOIN logic between configuration_ui and option collections
- [x] 3.5 Implement backward compatibility handling during transition period
- [x] 3.6 Add error handling for SQL queries involving configuration_ui table
- [x] 3.7 Optimize query performance for configuration_ui data fetching
- [x] 3.8 Verify tests pass for enhanced SQL functions

### 4. Missing Collection Handling and Edge Cases

- [x] 4.1 Write tests for missing collection scenarios and edge cases
- [x] 4.2 Implement graceful handling when configuration_ui references non-existent collections
- [x] 4.3 Add logic to maintain sort order even when some collections are unavailable
- [x] 4.4 Create fallback component ordering when configuration_ui data is completely missing
- [x] 4.5 Implement warning system for configuration_ui data inconsistencies
- [x] 4.6 Add defensive programming for malformed sort values or null collection names
- [x] 4.7 Test configurator behavior with various missing collection combinations
- [x] 4.8 Verify tests pass for all missing collection handling scenarios

### 5. Integration Testing and Validation

- [x] 5.1 Write comprehensive integration tests for end-to-end configuration_ui sorting
- [x] 5.2 Test dynamic ordering behavior across different product lines
- [x] 5.3 Validate that existing option functionality remains unchanged
- [x] 5.4 Test performance impact of configuration_ui data loading and processing
- [x] 5.5 Verify UI components render correctly in database-defined order
- [x] 5.6 Test configurator behavior when configuration_ui sort values are updated
- [x] 5.7 Validate error handling and fallback scenarios work as expected
- [x] 5.8 Verify all integration tests pass for configuration UI sorting feature
