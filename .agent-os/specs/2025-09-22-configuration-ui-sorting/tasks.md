## Tasks

### 1. Configuration UI Data Structure and API Integration

- [ ] 1.1 Write tests for configuration_ui data loading functionality
- [ ] 1.2 Update ProductOptions type to include configuration_ui array with sort field
- [ ] 1.3 Modify get_dynamic_options() SQL function to include configuration_ui data in response
- [ ] 1.4 Update API slice to fetch and cache configuration_ui data with product options
- [ ] 1.5 Add error handling for malformed or missing configuration_ui data
- [ ] 1.6 Update Zustand store to manage configuration_ui state efficiently
- [ ] 1.7 Implement data validation for configuration_ui records (sort field, collection existence)
- [ ] 1.8 Verify tests pass for configuration_ui data integration

### 2. Dynamic Component Rendering System

- [ ] 2.1 Write tests for dynamic component ordering functionality
- [ ] 2.2 Create component mapping system that maps collection names to React components

- [ ] 2.4 Build filtered configuration_ui processor that excludes unavailable collections
- [ ] 2.5 Replace hardcoded JSX in ProductConfiguration.tsx with dynamic component rendering
- [ ] 2.6 Add fallback logic for collections missing from configuration_ui table

- [ ] 2.8 Verify tests pass for dynamic component rendering system

### 3. SQL Function Enhancement

- [ ] 3.1 Write tests for updated SQL functions with configuration_ui integration
- [ ] 3.2 Update get_dynamic_options() to query configuration_ui table and include sort data
- [ ] 3.3 Modify enhanced configurator functions to use configuration_ui instead of hardcoded arrays
- [ ] 3.4 Add proper JOIN logic between configuration_ui and option collections
- [ ] 3.5 Implement backward compatibility handling during transition period
- [ ] 3.6 Add error handling for SQL queries involving configuration_ui table
- [ ] 3.7 Optimize query performance for configuration_ui data fetching
- [ ] 3.8 Verify tests pass for enhanced SQL functions

### 4. Missing Collection Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] 4.1 Write tests for missing collection scenarios and edge cases
- [ ] 4.2 Implement graceful handling when configuration_ui references non-existent collections
- [ ] 4.3 Add logic to maintain sort order even when some collections are unavailable
- [ ] 4.4 Create fallback component ordering when configuration_ui data is completely missing
- [ ] 4.5 Implement warning system for configuration_ui data inconsistencies
- [ ] 4.6 Add defensive programming for malformed sort values or null collection names
- [ ] 4.7 Test configurator behavior with various missing collection combinations
- [ ] 4.8 Verify tests pass for all missing collection handling scenarios

### 5. Integration Testing and Validation

- [ ] 5.1 Write comprehensive integration tests for end-to-end configuration_ui sorting
- [ ] 5.2 Test dynamic ordering behavior across different product lines
- [ ] 5.3 Validate that existing option functionality remains unchanged
- [ ] 5.4 Test performance impact of configuration_ui data loading and processing
- [ ] 5.5 Verify UI components render correctly in database-defined order
- [ ] 5.6 Test configurator behavior when configuration_ui sort values are updated
- [ ] 5.7 Validate error handling and fallback scenarios work as expected
- [ ] 5.8 Verify all integration tests pass for configuration UI sorting feature
