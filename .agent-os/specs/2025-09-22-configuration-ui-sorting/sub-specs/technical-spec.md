# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-09-22-configuration-ui-sorting/spec.md

## Technical Requirements

### Configuration UI Data Loading
- Fetch configuration_ui records with sort field when loading product options
- Include configuration_ui data in the product options API response
- Cache configuration_ui data in Zustand store for efficient access
- Ensure configuration_ui data is available before rendering option sets

### Component Rendering Logic
- Replace hardcoded JSX ordering in ProductConfiguration.tsx with dynamic rendering
- Create reusable component mapping system that respects configuration_ui.sort order
- Implement graceful fallback when configuration_ui data is missing
- Maintain existing UI component functionality while changing only the ordering

### Missing Collection Handling
- Filter configuration_ui records to only include collections with available options
- Sort filtered configuration_ui records by sort field ascending
- Skip missing collections without affecting the sort order of available ones
- Log warnings when configuration_ui references non-existent collections

### SQL Function Updates
- Update get_dynamic_options() function to use configuration_ui instead of hardcoded arrays
- Modify enhanced configurator functions to respect configuration_ui ordering
- Ensure backward compatibility during transition period
- Add proper error handling for malformed configuration_ui data

### Data Flow Integration
- Integrate configuration_ui loading into existing API slice
- Update ProductOptions type to include configuration_ui information
- Ensure configuration_ui data flows through to React components
- Maintain separation of concerns between data loading and UI rendering

### Performance Considerations
- Load configuration_ui data once per product line selection
- Avoid re-fetching configuration_ui on every option change
- Use efficient sorting algorithms for configuration_ui records
- Consider memoization for computed configuration_ui-based component lists

## External Dependencies

No new external dependencies are required for this implementation. The feature uses existing Supabase infrastructure and React patterns already established in the codebase.
