# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Configuration UI Sorting
> Created: 2025-09-22

## Overview

Implement dynamic ordering of configuration option sets in the product configurator based on the sort field from the configuration_ui database collection. This ensures that option sets are displayed in the correct order defined by the database, even when some collections are not available for specific product lines.

## User Stories

### Configuration Display Order

As a product manager, I want configuration option sets to appear in the order defined by the configuration_ui table, so that the user experience is consistent and follows our intended information hierarchy.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. Product manager updates sort values in configuration_ui table through admin interface
2. Configurator automatically reflects the new ordering without code changes
3. When certain collections aren't available for a product line, the available ones still maintain their relative sort order
4. Users see a consistent, logical progression through configuration options

### Developer Experience

As a developer, I want the configurator to automatically respect database-driven ordering, so that I don't need to hardcode option set sequences in multiple places.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. Developer loads configuration_ui data with sort values
2. React components automatically render option sets in sort order
3. Missing collections are gracefully skipped while maintaining order
4. No manual JSX reordering required when business requirements change

## Spec Scope

1. **Configuration UI Data Loading** - Fetch configuration_ui records with sort field for current product line
2. **Dynamic Component Ordering** - Render option set components in configuration_ui.sort order
3. **Missing Collection Handling** - Skip unavailable collections while preserving sort order for available ones
4. **SQL Function Updates** - Replace hardcoded collection arrays with configuration_ui-driven queries
5. **Fallback Logic** - Gracefully handle missing configuration_ui entries with sensible defaults

## Out of Scope

- Admin interface for managing configuration_ui sort values
- Performance optimization for configuration_ui queries
- Migration of existing configuration_ui data
- UI type rendering logic changes (focus only on ordering)

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Dynamic Option Set Ordering** - Product configurator displays option sets in configuration_ui.sort order
2. **Database-Driven Flexibility** - Sort order changes in configuration_ui immediately reflect in the UI
3. **Robust Missing Collection Handling** - Configurator works correctly even when some collections are unavailable for a product line
