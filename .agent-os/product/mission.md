## The Problem

### Complex Product Configuration

Custom mirror and lighting products have dozens of configuration options across 13 different attributes. Manual configuration leads to errors, missed options, and frustrated customers.

**Our Solution:** Intuitive interface that guides users through each configuration step with real-time visual feedback.

### Inefficient Quoting Process

Traditional quoting requires back-and-forth communication, manual calculations, and delays that can lose sales. This results in 40% longer sales cycles and increased administrative costs.

**Our Solution:** Instant quote generation with all specifications documented and exportable.

### Visualization Challenges

Customers struggle to envision how different options will look together. Static catalogs and sample photos don't show the exact configuration being considered.

**Our Solution:** Dynamic SVG-based rendering that updates in real-time as options are selected.

## Differentiators

### Real-Time Visual Configuration

Unlike traditional catalog-based systems, we provide instant visual feedback using dynamic SVG layers. This results in 60% fewer revision requests and higher customer satisfaction.

### Comprehensive Option Coverage

Unlike competitors who limit options to simplify their tools, we support all 13 configuration categories with intelligent filtering. This enables us to serve both simple and complex custom requirements.

### Cloud-Native Architecture

Unlike legacy desktop configurators, our Supabase-powered solution provides anywhere access with automatic updates. This enables teams to collaborate in real-time and access quotes from any device.
