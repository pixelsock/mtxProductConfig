## Architecture Principles (Maintained Throughout)

### Core Dynamic Principles
- **No Hard-Coded Business Logic**: All business rules, product definitions, and workflows must be API-driven
- **Backend-First Features**: New features should be configurable through Supabase tables, not code
- **Zero-Deployment Updates**: Product changes, rule modifications, and feature flags should require no code deployment
- **API-Driven UI**: Interface layout, styling, and behavior should adapt to backend configuration
- **Real-Time Responsiveness**: All dynamic features should reflect backend changes immediately

### Success Metrics
- **Configuration Flexibility**: 100% of product changes achievable without code deployment
- **API Coverage**: All business logic accessible via backend configuration
- **Update Speed**: Backend changes reflected in frontend within cache refresh time
- **Developer Independence**: Non-technical users can modify product behavior through admin interface
