## 2025-08-28: Directus-First, No Fallback Data

**ID:** DEC-005
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical/Process
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Development Team, AI Coding Agents

### Decision

Directus is the single source of truth. We never use fallback, mock, or hard-coded data for primary application paths. Remove and refactor any code that relies on local fallbacks. Features that cannot run against real Directus data must be blocked behind clear errors until data is available/configured.

### Context

Earlier iterations experimented with alternative backends and temporary data fallbacks. This created drift between what the UI showed and what the CMS contained, increasing maintenance costs and risk. The core goal is to manage the configurator entirely via Directus so non-developers can update options, rules, and assets without code changes.

### Rationale

- Single source of truth improves correctness and reduces divergence.
- Empowers operations via Directus, keeping the configurator dynamic and future-proof.
- Simplifies developer and agent workflows (fewer modes and branches).

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Strong alignment between CMS and runtime behavior
- Faster iteration on content/rules without code changes
- Lower long-term maintenance cost

**Negative:**
- Development can be blocked when Directus is misconfigured or unavailable
- Requires robust schema/endpoint validation in dev

### Supersedes

- Parts of DEC-001 (Supabase migration) and DEC-004 (Payload consolidation) that conflict with a Directus-first architecture.

## 2025-08-28: Terminal-First Validation & Tooling

**ID:** DEC-006
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Process/Tooling
**Stakeholders:** Development Team, AI Coding Agents

### Decision

Agents and developers validate behavior via the terminal. Prefer cURL, Node one-offs, and repository scripts over writing new test files. Use the Directus MCP tools for live API/schema inspection and Context7 for platform documentation. Avoid adding ad-hoc test suites or runners unless explicitly approved.

### Context

We have dev scripts (`scripts/`), and a strict preference for reproducible terminal checks against the live Directus API/SDK. This keeps validation close to production data and reduces dead test code.

### Rationale

- Ensures we test what we actually ship (real endpoints and schemas)
- Reduces maintenance of synthetic tests that drift from the CMS
- Speeds up agent workflows in constrained environments

### Consequences

**Positive:** Quick, realistic feedback loops with minimal overhead

**Negative:** Requires discipline to keep scripts current; less “unit-style” isolation

## 2025-08-28: Data-Driven Configurator (Rules in Directus)

**ID:** DEC-007
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product/Architecture
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

Model availability, constraints, and overrides in Directus (collections + rules). Keep application logic thin: interpret data and rules rather than hard-coding option matrices or conditionals. Users should be able to update rules/logic through Directus without code changes.

### Rationale

- Maximizes flexibility and non-technical control
- Reduces code churn when business rules evolve
- Improves consistency across product lines and future additions

### Consequences

**Positive:** Rapid iteration via CMS; clearer separation of concerns

**Negative:** Requires robust rule evaluation and guardrails in the app

## 2025-08-28: Configuration Images Deprecated; Use Product Images

**ID:** DEC-008
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product/UI
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Development Team

### Decision

Pause SVG/layer-based rendering and the `configuration_images` path. Use Directus product assets: `vertical_image`, `horizontal_image`, and `additional_images`. Orientation derives from mounting selection with graceful fallbacks.

### Rationale

- Aligns imagery with how products are managed in Directus
- Reduces bespoke rendering complexity while preserving visual clarity

### Consequences

**Positive:** Simpler pipeline, consistent with CMS assets

**Negative:** Fewer fine-grained visual compositions vs. SVG layers

## 2024-11-01: Supabase Migration Decision

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

Migrate from Directus CMS to Supabase for database and API management, using GraphQL interface for all data operations.

### Context

The product configurator initially used Directus as a headless CMS for product data management. As the application scaled and requirements evolved, we needed better cloud hosting options, GraphQL support, and potential for edge functions to handle business logic.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Stay with Directus**
   - Pros: No migration effort, familiar system, working implementation
   - Cons: Limited cloud hosting options, no native edge functions, GraphQL plugin limitations

2. **Move to Hasura**
   - Pros: Excellent GraphQL support, real-time subscriptions
   - Cons: Requires separate database, more complex setup, higher operational overhead

3. **Custom Node.js API**
   - Pros: Full control, custom business logic
   - Cons: High development effort, maintenance burden, need to build all features

### Rationale

Supabase was chosen because it provides:
- Native PostgreSQL with automatic GraphQL API generation
- Built-in edge functions for business logic
- Excellent local development story with Supabase CLI
- Cost-effective cloud hosting
- Strong TypeScript support and SDK

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Simplified infrastructure with integrated database and API
- Better performance with GraphQL
- Ability to add complex business logic via edge functions
- Improved developer experience with local Supabase

**Negative:**
- Migration effort required for existing data
- Team needs to learn Supabase-specific patterns
- Some Directus features (like asset transformation) need replacement

## 2024-12-05: Context7 Documentation Requirement

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Process
**Stakeholders:** Development Team, Tech Lead

### Decision

All code changes must reference relevant documentation through Context7 before implementation. Error messages and deprecation warnings must be addressed immediately.

### Context

As the codebase grows and integrates with multiple external services (Supabase, React, various libraries), keeping up with API changes and best practices becomes critical. Outdated code patterns lead to technical debt and potential security issues.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Manual documentation review**
   - Pros: No tooling required
   - Cons: Time-consuming, easy to miss updates, inconsistent

2. **Static documentation**
   - Pros: Fast reference, offline access
   - Cons: Quickly becomes outdated, no context awareness

### Rationale

Context7 provides up-to-date documentation directly in the development workflow, ensuring:
- Latest API references are always used
- Deprecation warnings are caught early
- Best practices are consistently applied
- Error messages provide actionable solutions

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Reduced bugs from outdated API usage

## 2025-01-07: Payload CMS Frontend Consolidation

**ID:** DEC-004
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical Architecture
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

Consolidate the React configurator frontend into Payload CMS's Next.js application structure, leveraging the unified backend/frontend architecture.

### Context

The MTX Product Configurator was initially built as a standalone React application (UMD widget) connecting to Supabase. With Payload CMS already in use for backend data management and its built-in Next.js frontend capabilities, maintaining two separate frontend systems creates unnecessary complexity.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Keep Separate Frontend**
   - Pros: No migration effort, independent deployment, embeddable widget capability
   - Cons: Two codebases, network latency for API calls, duplicate authentication systems

2. **Rebuild in Payload Admin**
   - Pros: Single codebase, unified auth
   - Cons: Limited to admin users only, loses customer-facing capability

3. **Create Payload Plugin**
   - Pros: Reusable across Payload projects
   - Cons: Complex plugin architecture, harder to customize

### Rationale

Integrating into Payload's frontend provides:
- **Unified Architecture**: Single Next.js application for both CMS and customer frontend
- **Local API Access**: Direct database queries via getPayload() - no network latency
- **Shared Authentication**: One auth system for admin and customer users
- **Better Performance**: Server-side rendering and React Server Components
- **Simplified Deployment**: One application to deploy and maintain
- **Code Reuse**: Share components between admin and frontend

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Eliminated network latency with Local API
- Simplified infrastructure (one app instead of two)
- Improved performance with SSR/RSC
- Unified authentication and user management
- Better SEO capabilities with Next.js
- Easier maintenance with single codebase

**Negative:**
- Loss of embeddable widget capability
- Migration effort required (estimated 1-2 weeks)
- Need to adapt to Next.js patterns from Vite
- Requires learning Payload's Local API patterns
