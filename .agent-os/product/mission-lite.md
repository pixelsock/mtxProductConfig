# Product Mission (Lite)

MTX Product Configurator is a fully dynamic, API-driven configuration tool that helps contractors, designers, and consumers easily configure and quote custom-made mirror and lighting products with all business logic, product options, and rules controlled by the Supabase backend for zero-deployment updates.

The configurator serves building professionals and designers who need efficient custom product specification with accurate quoting. Unlike traditional hard-coded catalog systems, MTX provides a completely dynamic architecture where Product Lines (Deco, Thin, Tech), configuration categories, and business rules are loaded in real-time from the API, enabling instant backend updates without code deployment while delivering real-time visual feedback and comprehensive option coverage.
